# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

- ## Overview

-This is a weather App that provides the user with the ability to preload clothing items to their own Profile Section, while designating what type of weather the item is meant for. Meanwhile, the App also filters through those cards in order to provide a suggestion on what to wear based on the weather in a specifed area. It then displays those filtered items in the Main Section. This react project is meant to demonstrate my know of React, but more importantly my underlying knowledge of the three primary languages HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It was very interesting to experience how well React brings these languages together and seems to operate almost intuitively.

- ## Technologies

- Utilization of Funtional components and nesting them in order to provide a very clear and Tidy Application. I utilized Context throughout the project in order pass varying temperatures of Fahrenheit and Celcius depending the user's input via a toggle switch. Implemented Routes accessable through Links in the header to maneuver from The Main Section of the project to the Profile Section of the App.

- ## Result

- I was very happy to learn how to use React and I am very excited to construct more applications in the future. I thoroughly enjoyed the stress of solving problems and learning how all of the pieces interact.
